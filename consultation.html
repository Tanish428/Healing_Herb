   <h2>Ayurveda Clinic India </h2>
  <h4>According to Ayurveda, all disease is caused by an imbalance in dosha (constitutions). Determining which of the dosha is imbalanced and thus the root cause of disease requires extensive training and knowledge.</h4>
  <br>
  <h4>At your initial consultation especially, be prepared to talk about yourself. Ayurveda emphasises balance in all areas of life and so the physician will be using various diagnostic methods to examine your body as well as taking an extensive personal and medical history. This may include amongst other matters, an understanding of your diet, your professional life and working conditions, relationships, mental health and exercise routines.</h4>
  <br>
  <h4>In this way the Ayurvedic Physician is able to identify the potential causes of imbalance in the mind or body and can provide a bespoke treatment plan that will include dietary advice, Ayurvedic herbal products and any other Ayurvedic treatments.</h4>

             <h4 style="text-align: left;">Consultations Ayurvedic treatment is aimed towards regaining our natural balanced state or 'prakruti' and the Ayurvedic practitioner considers all possible Ayurvedic treatments & techniques that could provide effective treatment for the patient to regain their health & equilibrium. The treatment has three stages.<br><br>
               The first stage of the consultation the Ayurvedic practitioner looks for causative factors and asks the patient to alter their diet & lifestyle as necessary.<br><br>
               Secondly seeking to strengthen the immune system of the patient with the relevant Ayurvedic remedies to balance or increase the digestive process or 'agni' and improve elimination. This helps to improve assimilation of nutrients in the diet and to aid in the elimination of waste products and toxins or 'ama' from the body.<br><br>
               Thirdly, treating the main symptoms or condition with suitable Ayurvedic herbal products to subdue the illness or disease process. The patient will also have the opportunity to voice any emotional or psychological problems that they may have as this also greatly effects the disease process.<br><br>

            <h4 style="text-align: left;">
              <b>Questions (Prashna)</b>
              <br><br>
              This takes up the majority of the consultation and involves investigation of the main complaint, symptoms and pathogenesis of the disorder as well as personal history. Patients will be greatly assisted by providing psychological, physical and lifestyle and nutrition information to the doctor.<br><br> </h4>
               <h4 style="text-align: left;">
              Observation (Darshan)<br><br>
              This is an evaluation of the patient by observing the patient. There are hundreds of key indicators that an Ayurvedic Physician may observe the patientâ€™s movements and physical appearance to investigate the imbalance.<br><br> </h4>

             <h4 style="text-align: left;">
               Palpation or touch (Sparsha)
               Touch includes palpation (pressing down on parts of the body called sparshanam in Ayurveda), auscultation (listening to sounds made by the internal organs or shrvanaa in Ayurveda) and percussion or tapping (akotana in Ayurveda). There is a focus on pulse and tongue diagnosis and other diagnostic methods which include sound observation in which breathing and the function of the stomach and bowel can be observed.<br><br> </h4>
